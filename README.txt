A react implementation of the very basics of the Uber app (without any trade secrets). As a mobile engineer, I was curious about how it would feel to build the first few screens of the rider app in react. Handled a few things:
* Delayed loading of product configurations
* Login screen that saves state in local storage
* Map tranlation animations after the geolocation results occur (happens after a few seconds)

This is a learning tool for myself. Open sourced it to pressure myself into cleaning it up a bit. Build with webpack.
